MachineLearningJS
=================

Neural Network implementation in JavaScript. The neural network itself is a port of Andrew Ng's Octave implementation from his machine learning Coursera class. The conjugate gradient minimization method is ported as well.

Linear algebra is handled using Numeric.js.

A running example is located at http://nameless-retreat-7481.herokuapp.com/
